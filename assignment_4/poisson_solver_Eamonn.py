This code creates a class 'PoissonSolver2D' to generate an NxN grid of points. The potentials and
charges of each point can be set (some presets have been built below). After setting these, the
grid is relaxed by 'bleeding' the potentials throughout the grid (i.e. repeated averaging of 
neighbouring points until an equilibrium is reached. After this, the potential can be evaluated at
any specified point using random walkers. These walkers freely move through the grid from a
starting point (i, j) until they reach a boundary position (x_b, y_b). After repeated use of the
walkers, a probability map (Green's function) is generated, telling us how often each site is
visited. This then can give us an estimate of the potential at the chosen starting point.
